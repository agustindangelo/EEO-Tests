# EEO Demos

Two automated test suites are going to be developed. 
Cypress tests are located in `cypress/e2e` and WebdriverIO tests are located in `wdio/test/specs`

# Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

# Run Cypress tests
Create a `cypress.env.json` file at the root of the project and paste with the following content:
```json
{
  "USER_EMAIL": "<your-email>",
  "USER_NAME": "<your-username>",
  "USER_PASSWORD": "<your-password>",
  "LOCAL_API_URL": "http://localhost:4000"
}
```
Make sure to have both eeoweb and eeoservice up and running before running the tests on the local environment

Run tests from the graphical test runner:
```
npm run cy:ui
```

Run the tests from the CLI and generate a Mochawesome report
```
npm run cy:run
```
tests execution reports should be available at `mochawesome-report/`

## Run a tagged test suite
To run a specific test suite specify its tag as follows:

bash:
```CYPRESS_INCLUDE_TAGS=HappyPath npm run cy:run```

powershell:
```cmd /C "set CYPRESS_INCLUDE_TAGS=HappyPath && npm run cy:run"```

# Setup a Jenkins local instance
1. Download the [latest stable Jenkins WAR file](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) to an appropriate directory on your machine.
2. Run the jenkins instance with `java -Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP="" -jar jenkins.war` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. The first time you will be asked for a password. Refer to the official documentation for any inconveniences: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/war-file/
3. Create a new pipeline by clicking the `New Item` button on the Jenkins' UI. You can name it "eeo-pipeline".

6. On the SCM field, select Git.
7. On the repository URL, enter the GitHub repo URL: https://github.com/agustindangelo/EEO-Tests
8. In order to grant access to Jenkins to fetch the remote repository, you need to create an access token on your Github account with scopes "repo" and "user". You can name it something like "jenkins-access-token". Copy the access token.
